**Battle Against Frakjaw!** is a minigame in [Ninjago
Monastery](/wiki/Ninjago_Monastery "wikilink") in the Cave of Black Echoes. It
takes place at the [Fire Shrine](/wiki/Fire_Shrine "wikilink"), and players
must defeat [Frakjaw](/wiki/Frakjaw "wikilink") in order to claim the Sword of
Fire. Up to four players can play within a single instance.

Frakjaw is fought similarly to the [Spider
Queen](/wiki/Spider_Queen "wikilink"), as he fights one-on one with players
while releasing minions to fight with him and has multiple stages of his
battle. Unlike the Spider Queen, however, most of the fighting is done
by [Skulkins](/wiki/Skulkin "wikilink") as opposed to Frakjaw himself. Like
the Spider Queen and [Maelstrom Dragons](/wiki/Maelstrom_Dragon "wikilink"),
Frakjaw has a health bar which appears on the player's UI rather than
above his head.

## Gameplay

Players enter the Battle Against Frakjaw! via a Fortress Dragon Statue
located in the [Cave of Black Echoes](/wiki/Cave_of_Black_Echoes "wikilink").
The Fire Shrine is set atop a rock face and cannot be reached by
players. Worse still, Frakjaw is waiting near the shrine, guarding the
Golden Sword of Fire.

When players arrive at the Fire Shrine, Frakjaw summons a wave of
Skulkins, usually consisting of [Skeleton
Raiders](/wiki/Skeleton_Raider "wikilink"), [Skeleton Mad
Scientists](/wiki/Skeleton_Mad_Scientist "wikilink"), [Skeleton
Blacksmiths](/wiki/Skeleton_Blacksmith "wikilink"), and [Skeleton
Troopers](/wiki/Skeleton_Trooper "wikilink"). When these enemies are defeated,
a [Quick Build](/wiki/Quick_Build "wikilink") for a Skull-a-Ton appears, which
can be built right above Frakjaw's head. It falls and lands on Frakjaw,
depleting a third of his [armor](armor "wikilink") meter.

Frakjaw summons another wave of enemies, this time also including [Bone
Wolves](/wiki/Bone_Wolf "wikilink") and [Skeleton
Commandos](/wiki/Skeleton_Commando "wikilink"). Defeating these enemies drops
another Skull-a-Ton Quick Build, which depletes another third of
Frakjaw's armor. Frakjaw tries again to defeats players by summoning a
third wave, ultimately ending with a third and final Quick Build. This
Skull-a-Ton fully depletes the remainder of Frakjaw's armor.

Frakjaw climbs down from his perch and fights players himself, summoning
another wave to assist him. Like [Chopov](/wiki/Chopov "wikilink"),
[Krazi](/wiki/Krazi "wikilink"), and [Bonezai](Bonezai "wikilink"), Frakjaw's
[Maelstrom](/wiki/Maelstrom "wikilink") [Spinjitzu](Spinjitzu "wikilink")
causes deadly Maelstrom Poisoning, but encompasses a much wider radius
than his predecessors. When his minions are defeated, Frakjaw summons
another wave of enemies to take their place.

Eventually, Frakjaw is [smashed](smashed "wikilink"). He only drops
mission-related items, such as his jawbone, and a final Quick Build that
assembles a Fire Lantern, allowing players to access the Fire Shrine,
collect the Sword of Fire, and open a [Treasure
Chest](/wiki/Treasure_Chest "wikilink") full of loot.

Players can leave the Battle Against Frakjaw! at any time using a Fire
Lantern and interacting with the Fortress Dragon Statue.

## Frakjaw Drops (Rare Items)

Frakjaw, upon being smashed, leaves behind a treasure chest containing a
variety of loot including tokens, Maelstrom Infected Bricks, consumables
and a number of other common to rare [Ninjago
items](/wiki/Ninjago_Items "wikilink").

## Trivia

-   Being in a team gives players a higher chance of getting rare loot
    from Frakjaw.
-   The exact number of enemies summoned by Frakjaw varies depending on
    number of players in the instance.
-   When Frakjaw is smashed, any other Skulkins at the Fire Shrine are
    simultaneously smashed as well.
-   When Frakjaw is smashed, you see a top hat as one of his parts
    (which may be the same action when the Bone Daddy is smashed).
