**Ants** were creatures in [Nimbus Park](/wiki/Nimbus_Park "wikilink"). While
they could be smashed, it is unknown if they had the ability to hurt the
player. They spawned from ant hills scattered around the premesis. [1]

## Trivia

-   On December 19th, 2011, a [LEGO Universe](/wiki/LEGO_Universe "wikilink")
    GM named Shival hosted a party for players in [Nexus
    Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower_(World) "wikilink"), spawning various objects,
    including a [Maelstrom](/wiki/Maelstrom "wikilink")-fuming ant hill. No
    ants were present, however.
