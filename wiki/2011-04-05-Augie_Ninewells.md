**Augie Ninewells**, originally known as **Butch Blatterwhistle** on
Storm Universe, is an [Assembly](/wiki/Assembly "wikilink") Guard NPC in the
[Nexus Core](/wiki/Nexus_Core "wikilink") of the [Nexus
Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower "wikilink").

Noticing that [Imagination](/wiki/Imagination "wikilink") was bursting some of
the pipes, Augie Ninewells sends players to repair four of the burst
Imagination pipes located throughout Nexus Tower.

Augie harbors distrust towards [Paradox](/wiki/Paradox "wikilink") and feels
uncomfortable with the faction experimenting with
[Maelstrom](/wiki/Maelstrom "wikilink") so close to the [Imagination
Nexus](/wiki/Imagination_Nexus "wikilink"). Thus, he keeps a close eye on
them. Noticing that they've been messing with the power system, he sends
players to repair open power panels located in the [Paradox
Laboratory](/wiki/Paradox_Laboratory "wikilink").

Later, Augie Ninewells gives [Daily Missions](/wiki/Daily_Missions "wikilink")
exclusively to Assembly members. These missions include fighting
[Stromlings](/wiki/Stromlings "wikilink"), participating in [Avant Gardens
Survival](/wiki/Avant_Gardens_Survival "wikilink"), competing in
[races](/wiki/Race_Track "wikilink"), and building [Maelstrom
Turrets](/wiki/Maelstrom_Turrets "wikilink").

## Pre-Alpha Information

Concept art for Augie Ninewells, originally known as an Assembly Scout,
was found in a [beta](beta "wikilink") directory for [Nimbus
Park](/wiki/Nimbus_Park "wikilink") mission-giver renderings, along with
concept art for [Trek Furino](/wiki/Trek_Furino "wikilink"), [Meyer
Muckrake](/wiki/Meyer_Muckrake "wikilink"), and a [Sentinel
Guard](/wiki/Sentinel_Guard "wikilink"). This suggests that he, along with
Trek and Meyer, were originally meant to be located in Nimbus Park or an
early [Avant Gardens](/wiki/Avant_Gardens "wikilink"). While his occupation is
now listed as a guard, his texture is still labeled "Assembly Scout".
Additionally, renderings of Augie Ninewells seen in a Nexus Tower promo
and the in-game Mission Indicator depict him with the Assembly Scout's
textures.

## Trivia

-   "Augie" is a town in Nigeria known for its government. His last name
    is likely derived from NineWells, a famous player in LEGO Universe.
    This is supported by fact of the distinguishable name change between
    servers. Alternatively, "Ninewells" may be derived from the number
    of pipe quick-builds in Nexus Tower or an area in Scotland known for
    its hospital.
-   Augie Ninewells is the only mission-giver with a different name
    across servers.
