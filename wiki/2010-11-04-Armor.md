## **For Minifigs**

![](Armormeter.png "Armormeter.png") **Armor** is a meter which minifigs
do not begin with, but which is earned and improved by equipping new
accessories and earning new ranks in their
[factions](factions "wikilink"). Armor will generally be the first meter
to be depleted when under attack, so it's a great way to avoid getting
too badly damaged. However, armor will run down and once it reaches 0,
all damage is routed to the [Health](/wiki/Health "wikilink") meter. Armor can
be replenished in several ways for minifigs:

-   Gathering Armor Power-ups (Dropped by most enemies in [Forbidden
    Valley](/wiki/Forbidden_Valley "wikilink") and [Gnarled
    Forest](/wiki/Gnarled_Forest "wikilink"), less commonly in [Avant
    Gardens](/wiki/Avant_Gardens "wikilink"); obtained by smashing
    [Smashables](/wiki/Smashables "wikilink"))
-   Using [consumables](/wiki/Consumable "wikilink") (such as [Armour
    Polish](/wiki/Armour_Polish "wikilink"), [Armor
    Gleam](/wiki/Armor_Gleem "wikilink"))
-   Using Special Items (such as the [Yo-Ho-Mug](/wiki/Yo-Ho-Mug "wikilink"))
-   Using the repair ability of the [Engineer](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink") or
    [Summoner](/wiki/Summoner "wikilink").

N.B.: The repair ability, contrary to popular belief, does not restore
the armor of nearby allies unless within minigames or instances. To
activate its repair effect, hold the Alt key or left mouse button. The
longer its held, the more it recharges the armor meter, but there is a
maximum limit to the increase per move. It will likely be necessary to
press and hold the *Alt*key multiple times to replenish a meter of more
than 3.

Many pieces of equipment will increase maximum Armor. Please note,
however, that increased maximum Armor will not increase actual Armor
score. As a result, if, for example, a player equips the [Scorpion
Shield](/wiki/Scorpion_Shield "wikilink"), his Armor score would stay at 0,
even though his maximum score is now 3. If items are unequipped and
re-equipped, the maximum Armor will be restored, but the **actual**
Armor score will need to be replenished.

## **For Enemies**

For normal enemies, there is no Armor meter (ex:
[Stromlings](/wiki/Stromlings "wikilink"), [Dark
Admirals](/wiki/Dark_Admirals "wikilink"), [Dark
Ronin](/wiki/Dark_Ronin "wikilink")). However, bosses such as the [Stromling
Ape](/wiki/Stromling_Apes "wikilink") and [Maelstrom
Dragon](/wiki/Maelstrom_Dragon "wikilink") have noticeable Armor meters. Their
meters work in a different way to a minifig's. When the Armor meter of a
Dragon or Ape is depleted, it drops to the ground, stunned (In other
words it is a secondary Health meter). The Armor meters of these beings
will be replenished according to circumstances.

-   For Stromling Apes, the Armor meter will be replenished fully at
    regular intervals, making it crucial to take one down quickly while
    it is stunned.
-   For Maelstrom Dragons, the Armor meter will not be replenished fully
    so long as a player is on a Dragon's platform. If all players on the
    instance are smashed, and there are no players in its vicinity, the
    Dragon's Health and Armor meters will be fully replenished
    instantly. Also, when the Dragon is stunned, it will drop the quick
    build needed to smash it.
