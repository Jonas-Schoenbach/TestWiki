**Bob** is a plain red and blue [Minifigure](/wiki/Minifigure "wikilink") that
is commonly shown in videos. In the walkthrough videos (taken at CES
2010), Bob appears to be one of the first official characters in the
game that a player interacts with, giving the player the ability to
store [Imagination](/wiki/Imagination "wikilink"), as well as being seen at
the [Log-in Screen](/wiki/Log-in_Screen "wikilink"). Always, when you are
typing your password, Bob will cover his eyes with his hands.
