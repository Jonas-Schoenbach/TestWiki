## Battle Siren

The Battle Siren is the midget tower next to [Melodie
Foxtrot](/wiki/Melodie_Foxtrot "wikilink"), who gives you the quest to survive
a minute in the [Avant Gardens Survival Instance](/wiki/Survival "wikilink").
The Siren directs players to the Survival Minigame, and this is the only
place to encounter [Chainsaw Stromlings](/wiki/Chainsaw_Stromling "wikilink")
(a.k.a: Sawlings) and another type of Stromling that looks like a
Hammerling, but is more powerful. The Battle Siren looks similarly like
a tower back in Medieval Times ,except much shorter.
