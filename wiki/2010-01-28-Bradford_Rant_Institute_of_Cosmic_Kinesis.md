**Bradford Rant** is marketing promotion for LEGO Universe. It is an ARG
or alternate reality game. In it, there is an institute, the Bradford
Rant Institute of Cosmic Kinesis (BRICK). The institute was founded by
Bradford Rant, who was then disappeared on Easter Island. They tracked 7
pods that landed on Earth, and the first person to find the pod, got to
keep it. Anyone else who visited that day got a T-shirt and got to
[alpha test](/wiki/Alpha_Test "wikilink") LEGO Universe. They uploaded data
from each pod that contain four letters, and when decoded, revealed the
phrase "ANSWER THE CALL. SAVE IMAGINATION". When entered on the site,
this revealed [trailer](/wiki/Trailer "wikilink") two.

## The Great Minifig Mission

The Bradford Rant promotion then migrated into "The Great Minifig
Mission" promotion in which LEGO account holders complete missions in
order to help minifigs enter the universe. A player achieves pioneer
status when he helps 5000 minifigs, but as of yet this has no
consequence. There is also a timer that ends on June 1, 2010 at 8:00pm
EST, and fans have speculated either that the game will begin then, or
the pre-order will be available.
