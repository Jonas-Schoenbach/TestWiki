**Bone Beetles** are skeletal insect enemies that would have appeared in
the unreleased [Fire Temple](/wiki/Fire_Temple "wikilink"). They were
showcased, along with other upcoming Ninjago enemies, in the
September-October 2011 issue of LEGO Club Magazine, which claimed that
Bone Beetles are invulnerable unless flipped onto its back, at which
point it becomes vulnerable to [Spinjitzu](/wiki/Spinjitzu "wikilink").
However, since [LEGO Universe](/wiki/LEGO_Universe "wikilink") was announced
to close, the Fire Temple was canceled, and Bone Beetles will not be
officially released.

## LEGO Club Magazine description

*This scuttling, armored nasty is immune to all of your attacks â€“ until
you flip him over! Unleash any Spinjitsu attack near the Beetle to knock
it onto its back. Then give it a few good whacks before it gets up
again!*

## Trivia

-   An Armored Bone Beetle has been found in the game files along with
    the original one, yet nobody knows what part the armored Beetle
    could have played in the game.
-   Armored Bone Beetles were spawned by a [Mythran](/wiki/Mythran "wikilink")
    in [Nimbus Plaza](/wiki/Nimbus_Plaza "wikilink") on January 3, 2012.
