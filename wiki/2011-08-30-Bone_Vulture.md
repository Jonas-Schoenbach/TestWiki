**Bone Vultures** are skeletal bird enemies that would have appeared in
the unreleased [Fire Temple](/wiki/Fire_Temple "wikilink"). They were
showcased, along with other upcoming Ninjago enemies, in the
September-October 2011 issue of LEGO Club Magazine, which claimed that
Bone Vultures screech before attack, are vulnerable to Lightning
[Spinjitzu](/wiki/Spinjitzu "wikilink"), and can summon whole flocks of Bone
Vultures. However, since [LEGO Universe](/wiki/LEGO_Universe "wikilink") was
announced to close, the Fire Temple was canceled, and Bone Vultures will
not be officially released.

## Attacks

-   **Dive**: The Bone Vulture swoops down towards players and attacks
    with its beak.
-   **Flock Call**: The Bone Vulture or Elite Bone Vulture circles over
    players, opening a vortex through which a Bone Vulture flock emerges
    and dive-bombs players.

## LEGO Club Magazine description

*The Vulture hovers close to the ground but when it lets out a screech,
it’ll dive in for a talon-razing attack! Be ready with a burst of
Lightning Spinjitsu to make it squawk! If you see the Vulture start to
circle, get out of the way! It’s about to call the rest of its flock and
they’re hungry for Ninja!*

## Trivia

-   A black-boned variation known as the Elite Bone Vulture was also
    created by developers.
-   A Bone Vulture was spawned by a [Mythran](/wiki/Mythran "wikilink") in
    [Nimbus Plaza](/wiki/Nimbus_Plaza "wikilink") on January 3, 2012.
