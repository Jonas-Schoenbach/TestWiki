alt="LEGO_Universe_2011-01-09_20-48-38.jpg" /> **Binoculars** are
objects located on nearly every [world](/wiki/Worlds "wikilink") in [LEGO
Universe](/wiki/LEGO_Universe "wikilink"). Interacting with one shows the
player a sweeping, cinematic view of a nearby area of the world in
question. Each world with binoculars has an achievement centered around
looking through all of the ones there. If a player has never looked
through a particular pair of binoculars, two glowing rings will be
floating in front of the lenses. Once the player looks through a pair of
binoculars once, the rings disappear.

## Trivia

-   The glowing rings were not added to the binoculars until late
    [Beta](/wiki/Beta_Test "wikilink"). Before then, it was very difficult for
    players to keep track of which ones they had already seen.
-   [Starbase 3001](/wiki/Starbase_3001 "wikilink") is the smallest world to
    include binoculars. There are only two pairs of binoculars located
    there.
