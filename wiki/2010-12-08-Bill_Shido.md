![](Bill_shido.JPG "Bill_shido.JPG") Bill Shido is the Ninja Messenger
NPC in Forbidden Valley. He stands near the [Fallen

his Ninja hood and cannot pass through the barrier.

## Trivia

-   Bill only seems aware of the stature side of [Dark
    Ronin](/wiki/Dark_Ronin "wikilink"), as he complains about only the
    statues and gives missions to smash them.
-   Bill wears player obtainable items, such as the Messenger bag, Ninja
    Buckler shield, and great Katana.
