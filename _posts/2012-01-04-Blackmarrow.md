**Blackmarrow** is a [named](/wiki/Named_Enemies "wikilink") [Skeleton
Engineer](/wiki/Skeleton_Engineer "wikilink") enemy who was planned to be
located on [Crux Prime](/wiki/Crux_Prime "wikilink"). However, before the
release of the world, Blackmarrow and another named enemy,
[Hardhead](/wiki/Hardhead "wikilink"), were removed. Blackmarrow is still
present in the game's coding, though, and can be spawned by
[Mythrans](/wiki/Mythran "wikilink").
