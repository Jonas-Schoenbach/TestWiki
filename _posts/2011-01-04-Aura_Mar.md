**Aura Mar** is an area in [Crux Prime](/wiki/Crux_Prime "wikilink"). It is
the home of the Maelstrom Dragon invader by the name of
[Butterscorch](/wiki/Butterscorch "wikilink").

At one time Crux Prime was set to be called Aura Mar, which was a large
battlefield outside [Nexus Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower "wikilink"). Aura Mar
would have been connected to Nexus Tower; both of them would be on the
same world.

This idea was dismissed due to the fact that
[Ninjago](/wiki/Ninjago "wikilink") was supposed to be incorperated into the
Game's story. The [Ninjago Monastery
Ruins](/wiki/Ninjago_Monastery_Ruins "wikilink") were taking up an entire
world, and this was much too small a place to be one.

Also, with the growing pain of the Game's Story playing out as it
should, NetDevil decided to merge the two worlds together, creating Crux
Prime, however leaving Nexus Tower to be it's own world.

There is one ancient scroll here!
