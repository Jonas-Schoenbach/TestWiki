alt="The Baron as he appears in Mission 10" /> **Baron Typhonus** is a
minifig who was searching for the last essence of pure imagination.
During the course of his quest his sanity slowly degraded, causing him
to inadvertantly create the dreaded force known as the Maelstrom.

## Quest for Pure Imagination

The Baron lived a long time ago, back when nothing could be created
freely. To solve this problem, the Baron decided to start a quest for
The Last Essence of Pure Imagination, so the imaginative ideas could
flow freely once again. He recorded his experiences into his diary,
parts of which was broadcasted to other people, later to be discovered
as part of the Minifig Mission.

The Baron and his colleague, Dr. Overbuild, were being led by the space
pirate, Hael Storm, to find the famous warrior knight, Duke Exeter. Duke
Exeter apparently knew the location of an ancient structure on the
planet known as Gallant 5. Upon finding clues about the mythical "First
Builders", the motley group set out to scour the stars for the Pure
Imagination.

For months they searched, without a bit of luck in finding the Pure
Imagination.

Soon, they began to notice a change in the Baron, who seemed to be
withdrawn from the others, spending most of his time recording events
and other data in his diary.

Baron Typhonus was losing his sanity.

When the expedition group reached the planet Crux, they found what they
were looking for: The Last Essence of Pure Imagination in the Universe!

Given free rein to create what ever they wanted, the entire group began
imagining their favorite things.

But the ambitious Baron had other plans.

He stated in his diary that "the only way the Universe can truly
flourish is if it is once again free of rules."

The First Builders left behind a code of honor that stated how the
Imagination should be used. This upset The Baron, who then imagined up a
hideous, Darkling spider, to demonstrate the power of chaos. But his new
pet proved unstable, for it dragged Baron Typhonus into the Pure
Imagination, corrupting the Essence. The Last Essence of Pure
Imagination mutated into the powerful, dark menace that seeks only to
destroy â€“

The Maelstrom!

## The Great Minifig Mission

Much of this story was gathered from the Great Minifig Mission on the
official LEGO Universe website. The Baron was formally named "The Baron"
in mission four. His last name was first revealed by translating the
minifig writing on the radios at missions two and seven. The Baron
appears to be a Minifig dressed in a tuxedo and a top hat. Judging from
the audio recordings found within Missions 2 and 7, the Baron appears to
have a British accent.
