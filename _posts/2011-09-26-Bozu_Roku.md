**Bozu Roku** is the leader of the Ninjago Villagers who took shelter in
the [Cave of Ancient Ways](/wiki/Cave_of_Ancient_Ways "wikilink") in the
[Ninjago Monastery](/wiki/Ninjago_Monastery "wikilink"). When [Skeleton Mad
Scientists](/wiki/Skeleton_Mad_Scientist "wikilink") captured seven of the
Ninjago Villagers, including Bozu, he was able to escape and hide on a
platform. [Hari Howzen](/wiki/Hari_Howzen "wikilink") witnessed the capture,
and being too scared to follow, lost track of the villagers, who were
imprisoned in cages.

Hari sends players to find Bozu and free the villagers. Bozu teachs
players to build alters in the caves, which dispense
[Imagination](/wiki/Imagination "wikilink") "from the heavens". He then sends
them to find schematic pages from Mad Scientists for the skeleton cages
to find a way to open them.

Once players find the pages, he then sends them to free the villagers.
Although they are captured again the next day, and appear again, Bozu
does not offer daily missions to find them, instead leaving this duty to
Hari.
