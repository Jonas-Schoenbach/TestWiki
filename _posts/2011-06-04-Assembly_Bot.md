alt="The Assembly Bot." />The **Assembly Bot** is a robot that can be
quick built by an [Engineer](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink"). It is the special
skill of the [Serratorizer](/wiki/Valiant_Weapons#Engineer "wikilink"). It
requires 8 Imagination to place the Quick Build and 1 Imagination to
build the Bot.

The Assembly Bot usually remains stationary, only moving towards enemies
when needed. They shoot two shots at once at enemies dealing 3 damage.

## Trivia

-   The Assembly Bot looks like a [Broombot](/wiki/K-733N "wikilink"), except
    the light on top has a different colour and the brooms are aimed
    forward, rather than downward.
-   Although it shows they shoot two shots at once, in reality it is
    only one shot.
