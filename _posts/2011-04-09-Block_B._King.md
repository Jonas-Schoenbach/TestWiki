**Block B. King**was a pre-alpha character who appeared in a piece of
early concept art for [LEGO Universe](/wiki/LEGO_Universe "wikilink"). The
closest he ever got to an in-game appearance was in an unused texture
for roadside billboards, where it was advertised he would be performing
at the [Hard Block Cafe](/wiki/Hard_Block_Cafe "wikilink"). However, as most
of the other billboard textures are comedic placeholders,[1] it is
likely he was not intended to be an actual in-game NPC.

## Trivia
