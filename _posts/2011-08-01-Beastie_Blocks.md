The **Beastie Blocks** was a music and dance group from [LEGO
Universe's](/wiki/LEGO_Universe "wikilink") developmental phase, originally
designed for [Nimbus Park](/wiki/Nimbus_Park "wikilink").

The Beastie Blocks originally consisted of three members; as one of them
was named [Beastie Brick A](/wiki/Skee_Daddle "wikilink") in beta testing, it
is possible that the other two would have been named Beastie Brick B and
Beastie Brick C. Beastie Brick A had a classic smile and wore an askew
dark-gray baseball cap, a light-gray Speed Racer shirt, and dark-gray
pants. The second member of the Beastie Blocks had a Vernon Dursley
mustache and wore a backwards white baseball cap, a dark-gray Mutt
Williams jacket, and white pants. The third member of the Beastie Blocks
was the only woman in the group, with white princess hair, a white
[Zipper Jacket](/wiki/Shirts "wikilink"), and light-blue pants.

In alpha testing and early beta testing, only Beastie Brick A appeared
in [Red Blocks Amphitheater](/wiki/Red_Blocks "wikilink"). In early beta
testing, [Johnny Thunder](/wiki/Johnny_Thunder "wikilink") had a mission
called "[Concert Flyers](/wiki/Heartthrob "wikilink")", in which the player
had to hand out flyers of the Beastie Blocks to [Green
Brockley](/wiki/Green_Brockley "wikilink"), [DeeDee
Light](/wiki/DeeDee_Light "wikilink"), [Krista
Clear](/wiki/Krista_Clear "wikilink"), and [Sofie
Cushion](/wiki/Sofie_Cushion "wikilink"). Beastie Brick A was eventually
shortened to simply Beastie Brick and then later renamed Skee Daddle,
dropping the Beastie Blocks reference from his name, and Johnny
Thunder's mission was altered to more directly involve the famed
adventurer's attempts to appeal to the concert ladies, thus the Beastie
Blocks flyers were removed.

Skee Daddle was given a new model after Founder's Release, although [DJ
Studd](/wiki/DJ_Studd "wikilink") still uses Beastie Brick A's model. There
are currently no other references to the Beastie Blocks in the released
game.
