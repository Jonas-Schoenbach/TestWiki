![](Backpack.JPG "Backpack.JPG")The **Backpack** is a feature in LEGO
Universe in which you store all of your [items](items "wikilink"),
[models](models "wikilink"), [bricks](bricks "wikilink") and
[behaviors](behaviors "wikilink"). In the Alpha and early Beta, only
items were stored in the backpack; models, bricks, and behaviors were
stored in a Brick Box.
