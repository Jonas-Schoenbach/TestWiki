![](Stromling.jpg "Stromling.jpg") **Survival** is a
[minigame](/wiki/Minigames "wikilink") in [Avant
Gardens](/wiki/Avant_Gardens "wikilink") where players fight endless waves of
[Stromlings](/wiki/Stromlings "wikilink"), [Mechs](Stromling_Mech "wikilink"),
and [Spiderlings](/wiki/Dark_Spiderlings "wikilink") until they are smashed.
It is possible to form a team of up to four people to play in this game.

This game is also notable for being one of the requirements to earn a
[Sentinels](/wiki/Sentinel "wikilink") Badge. It is unlocked by speaking to
Melodie Foxtrot outside the booth, although the mission is only
available after talking to the Sentinels Representative. After
completing the mission, the game can be accessed at any time.

## Game Progress

At the beginning of the game, players will be faced with a force of
Stromlings, that will try and maintain a number of about five or six.
The numbers of basic Stromlings rapidly increases, however.**NOTE: These
Stromlings can run much much faster than standard Avant Gardens
Stromlings.**

At about 1:30 on the timer, the first Stromling Mechs will spawn. Over
time, the numbers of these Mechs will increase, and they will start
spawning on all sides of the field. They have homing shots as of a
recent patch. These shots generally continue flying until they hit the
ground, a wall, or a player, although they do eventually dissipate if
they do not hit an object. The Mechs that spawn at the beginning only
have 4 Health. At about 2-3 minutes, [Dark
Spiderlings](/wiki/Dark_Spiderlings "wikilink") begin spawning. These too have
powerful homing blasts. These Spiderlings have less health than their
[Avant Gardens](/wiki/Avant_Gardens "wikilink") counterparts, but are still
much harder to take down than earlier enemies.

At about 6 minutes, a special type of [Stromling](/wiki/Stromlings "wikilink")
begins to spawn. These glow differently and have chainsaws instead of
claws. Their attack is considerably more powerful than those the earlier
Stromlings, and they have 4 health, making it impossible to use the
double-jump annihilation tactic.

As the game progresses from this point, all the enemies begin gaining
higher maximum health, and it becomes considerably harder to smash the
Spiderlings and Mechs, even if they are the survivors of the ones that
spawned at the beginning of the game.

## Tactics

There are several ways to survive the Survival Game. The classical way
is to cooperate with team mates, and attack the Stromlings as they
spawn. A useful tactic in this case is to use a double-jump attack. This
causes all the stromlings around the player to receive 1 damage, and
against the earlier enemies, this can cause them to smash instantly.

Another tactic is the 'Fortress' technique. This revolves around the
[Assembly](/wiki/Assembly "wikilink") player(s) establishing and maintaining a
'base' with turrets and creatures. This 'base' is then defended by the
other members of the team.

A popular tactic, which is most successful for solo players, is simply
to run away after a certain point, keeping ahead of the swarms of
Stromlings, and thus avoiding their attacks. This strategy is best used
when the player has a large supply of
[consumables](/wiki/Consumables "wikilink") to replenish Armor, Health, and to
a lesser extent, Imagination. A useful addition to this strategy is to
use a mass-attack ability, such as the Assembly Personal Fortress, which
can sweep away a large number of the enemies, making your escape much
easier for a little while.

Whichever strategy is used, there are several abilities which are very
useful. The Venture Faction's Buccanneers and Daredevils can use their
Speed Boost abilities to great effect. Another useful item is the
Quicksicle, as it allows players to outpace their pursuers. It also
makes it very difficult for the ranged enemies such as Stromling Mechs
and Spiderlings to hit their targets.

There are also known bugs which some players exploit to last much
longer. For instance, there is a point at which a player can jump behind
a wall and be jammed into it, avoiding all the Mechs and Spiderlings.

Another useful point to note is that there are **Survival Buff
Stations** which come in the form of periodic quick-builds across the
game area. These can be built at the cost of 1 imagination, and they
generate Health, Armor and Imagination power-ups until they are smashed.

## Achievements and Rewards

There are numerous [achievements](achievements "wikilink") and rewards
for surviving a length of time in this game. For instance, it is
possible to win a Helm of Entanglement. Many of these achievements
require the player to be solo.

## Trivia

-   Whenever an ability such as the Assembly Turret is used in Survival,
    the [Imagination](/wiki/Imagination "wikilink") cost is actually higher
    than outside the minigame.
-   In earlier versions of the game, the shots fired by Mechs and
    Spiderlings travelled in straight lines. The Development team stated
    in a message that this was removed in order to make the game more
    challenging, and to remove the possibility of 'Exploits'.
-   The achievement "Nonething left for dead" is based on a zombie
    survival game called "Left 4 Dead".
-   The achievements "Outwit", "Outplay", and "Outlast" are all
    references to the motto of the Reality show Survivor, so are the
    achievements "Survivor" and "Ultimate Survivor" (the title given to
    the player who wins the game in the show)
-   The achievement "Be Prepared" is a reference to the Boy Scout motto.
