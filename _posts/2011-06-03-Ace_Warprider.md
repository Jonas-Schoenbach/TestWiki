**Ace Warprider** is the Modules [Vendor](/wiki/Vendors "wikilink") of [Nexus
Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower "wikilink").

Ace Warprider's booth is located in the [Venture League Map
Room](/wiki/Venture_League_Map_Room "wikilink"). There, he sells the Nose
Cones, Cockpits, and Engines of the [Nexus Dropship
Rocket](/wiki/Rocket#Nexus_Dropship_Rocket "wikilink"), [Nexus Tower
Rocket](/wiki/Rocket#Nexus_Tower_Rocket "wikilink"), [Venture Koi
Rocket](/wiki/Rocket#Venture_Koi_Rocket "wikilink"), and [Musclenaut GT
Rocket](/wiki/Rocket#Musclenaut_GT_Rocket "wikilink").

At one point, [Achilles Plutarch](/wiki/Achilles_Plutarch "wikilink") lent Ace
Warprider [Meyer Muckrake's](/wiki/Meyer_Muckrake "wikilink") [Thinking
Hat](/wiki/Thinking_Hat "wikilink") in exchange for the astronaut's jetpack.
While the Spartan used the jetpack to get a high score in the [Nexus
Tower Combat Challenge](/wiki/Nexus_Tower_Combat_Challenge "wikilink"), Ace
lent the Imagination Hat to [Gwen
Tweenbangle](/wiki/Gwen_Tweenbangle "wikilink") in exchange for her smoke
machine. He used the smoke machine with the Venture League Map Room's
hologram of [Planet Crux](/wiki/Planet_Crux "wikilink"), creating an
impressive light show.

When players are sent by Achilles Plutarch to return Ace Warprider's
jetpack, the astronaut tells players about the smoke machine that he
borrowed from Gwen Tweenbangle. He proceeds to give the smoke machine to
players and asks that they return it to the pop star. It is suggested
that Ace Warprider uses his jetpack to clean [Hael
Storm's](/wiki/Hael_Storm "wikilink") telescope lens.

## Before LEGO Universe

Ace Warprider originated as the Spaceman from Series 1 Minifigures.

According to the Minifigures website, Ace Warprider is from the future
and, after an accident involving a runaway comet and a black hole,
traveled back in time to the present day. He is apparently not aware of
this and is under the mistaken belief that he is on an alien planet.
Despite all his gear and his knowledge of useful alien phrases, Ace is
not particularly skilled; he is not particularly strong or creative, and
is very lacking in speed. Ace Warprider is also one of two playable
characters in the Target Zapper online game and is one of the possible
results for the "Which Sci-Fi Minifigure are you?" quiz, which describes
the Spaceman as a friendly and prepared space explorer. In a short
animation, Ace Warprider is seen in the audience watching the Nurse and
Zombie dance.
