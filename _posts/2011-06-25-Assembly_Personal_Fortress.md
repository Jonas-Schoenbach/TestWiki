alt="An Assembly Personal Fortress" />The **Assembly Personal Fortress**
is a device that can be built by an [Engineer](/wiki/Engineer "wikilink"). It
is the skill of the [Engineer Vest/Gilet
3](/wiki/Engineer#Engineer_Vest.2FGilet_3 "wikilink"). It requires 10
imagination to build the Fortress.

The Fortress remains stationary when built, shooting at all enemies in
front of it in a cone. The Fortress fires 16 shots at all enemies in
front of the user, each shot dealing 1 damage.

## Beta

Before the [Nexus Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower "wikilink") Patch, the Personal
Fortress did 2X16 damage, but had a two minute cool down. It has since
been changed to 1X16, but with a thirty second cool down.
