## Bradford Rant Institute Description

Graduating with honors from Herschel University’s Faculty of Applied
Sciences (Astrophysics) in 1965, Bradford Rant completed a Masters in
Physical Cosmology at the Messier Institute of Technology; writing his
thesis on a critical analysis of Flügel’s multi-universe interpretation
(MUI).

In the 1970s, Rant worked as a special assistant to Italian physicist
Giacomo ‘Como’ Berenices, before returning to the United States to take
a position at **31324a0d0a.**

It was during this period that Rant took an interest in the study of
heliophysics. Though largely an environmental science, heliophysics
exposed Rant to the notion of interactivity and in 1974, combined with
his studies of MUI, he developed the basis of a theory what would come
to be known as cosmic kinesis.

Two years and many drafts later, Rant completed his Theory of cosmic
kinesis as it relates to negative curvature. Despite being
comprehensively referenced, and containing an introduction from the
eminent MUI advocate, Kennard de Fleur-Rimny, Rant had little success in
gaining support among colleagues for his work and he failed to secure
peer reviews for the paper.

Suspecting larger forces were responsible for his ostracism from the
astrophysics community and sacked without warning from his position at
**363536303638**, Rant decided to set up his own organisation in order
to further his research. In 1984, the Bradford Rant Institute of Cosmic
Kinesis was founded.

A year later, Rant disappeared while on a scientific expedition to
Easter Island. He was never seen again.
