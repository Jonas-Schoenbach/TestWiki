![](Bone_Fracture_Bomb.jpg "Bone_Fracture_Bomb.jpg")**Bone Fracture
Bombs** are pieces of skeleton equipment located in the [Maelstrom
Quarry](/wiki/Maelstrom_Quarry "wikilink") of [Crux
Prime](/wiki/Crux_Prime "wikilink"). They are similar to the corrupted chests
in Gnarled Forest, and will explode if attacked. When smashing them, be
sure to use ranged weapons, or a melee weapon with a long reach or you
will get smashed.
