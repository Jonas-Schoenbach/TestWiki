## Announcement and Release Dates

A **Beta Test** for LEGO Universe was first announced at the 2010
Consumer Electronics Show, also known as CES. The beta release date is
believed by some to be set for the end of March 2010 (based on a few
assumptions from the countdown on the Minifig Mission page on the LEGO
Universe website), although the original date of beta testing was set
for February 25, only to be prolonged for unknown reasons. While the
beta was rescheduled for release on Febrary 27, it was once again
prolonged. On March the 10th, the first round of beta keys were sent out
to those who were not alphas. (AKA. Regular users.) However, it has been
confirmed that this is not the only round of keys to be sent, and that
there will be plenty more sent out over the next few weeks.

## Pre-Beta Stage

The game has already undergone an [Alpha
Testing](/wiki/Alpha_Test_Phase "wikilink") phase. Alpha Testers composed of
LEGO Kids Inner Circle members, LEGO employees and their family members,
chosen visitors at CES 2010, and people who visited locations where the
[pods](/wiki/Bradford_Rant "wikilink") had landed. These people got to try out
the game (based on a set schedule), and report bugs that they found, in
order to prepare the game for the Beta test phase.

## Sign Ups

On Febuary 3, the producer of LEGO Universe released a [link to sign up
for beta testing](http://twitter.com/therabbitshole/status/8595440966),
but it does not guarantee that you will be chosen. Since then, the sign
up page has also been sent out to Newsletter subscribers, My LEGO
Network users, and members of the LEGO Kids Inner Circle. On March 2,
the beta signup page was posted in the official LEGO Universe news
section on the LEGO Universe website. While signups are still open for
applications, only a limited amount of users will be allowed to test
when the beta phase is closed to further applicants.

## Compatability

The Alpha version of LEGO users only worked on Windows computers with at
least a gigabyte of RAM, a hefty video card, and quite a bit of hard
drive space. A Mac version was never available, although at the time the
LEGO Universe team stated that they were looking into the matter. Some
improvements in compatability are possible, although it has been stated
that a Mac version will more than most likely remain unavailable at this
stage of the game. However, some alpha testers were able to load the
game within a Windows emulator, such as Parallels Desktop or VMware
Fusion. When the beta is released, these will be the only options for
Mac users. It is expected that a Mac version will be released with the
[Live 1](/wiki/Live_1 "wikilink") launch.

## Declaration of Secrecy

The [Declaration of Secrecy](/wiki/Declaration_of_Secrecy "wikilink") was a
document created by LEGO in order to restrain alpha testers from posting
pictures, videos, or posts about the LEGO Universe gameplay. This
declaration remains throughout the closed beta period as well, with the
exact specifications as before.

## Open Beta Myths

As of now, no one is sure if there will be an open beta phase, although
there are a couple of arguements that could be brought against such a
theory:

-   Several early mentions of the closed-beta phase refer to the phase
    as the FINAL phase before [Live 1](/wiki/Live_1 "wikilink") release
-   Since the "closed beta" has been revealed to everyone that follows
    LEGO Universe development (how else would they do so, but on the
    official site, wherein a link to signup for closed beta was given),
    then technically it is an open beta anyway

There is still a chance that an open beta will be released, and LEGO
will tell you they're undecided if you email them on the matter.
