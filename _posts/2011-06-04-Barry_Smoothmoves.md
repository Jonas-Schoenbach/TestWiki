## Before LEGO Universe

Barry Smoothmoves originated as the Disco Dude from Series 2
Minifigures.

According to his Bio on the Minifigures website, Barry Smoothmoves is
obsessed with everything about the 1970s, including disco dancing,
bell-bottom pants, and LEGOLAND Space. Whenever he hears disco music, he
cannot stop dancing and causes other people to dance with him. Barry
Smoothmoves has maximum creativity and is very fast, but he has only
average strength. He is one of two playable characters in the Disco
Dance Challenge online game, costarring with [Gwen
Tweenbangle](/wiki/Gwen_Tweenbangle "wikilink"). Barry Smoothmoves also makes
a cameo appearance as a civilian in Invasion from Planet X2Â½, in which
he must be protected by the A.D.U. or abducted by the Aliens.
