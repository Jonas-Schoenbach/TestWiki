**Axon Klaxon** is a [Brick](/wiki/Bricks "wikilink")
[Vendor](/wiki/Vendors "wikilink") [NPC](NPC "wikilink") in the [Assembly
Storeroom](/wiki/Assembly_Storeroom "wikilink") in [Nexus
Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower "wikilink").

Like [Bruno Underbite](/wiki/Bruno_Underbite "wikilink"), Axon Klaxon sells
primarily basic bricks, but he also notably sells a Dish 6x6 Inverted
Brick. This specific brick is needed by [Doctor
Overbuild](/wiki/Doctor_Overbuild "wikilink") to complete his Property Scanner
by mirroring the dorsal inverse retro-encabulator. If players do not
already have a Dish 6x6 Inverted Brick, Overbuild sends them to purchase
one from Axon Klaxon.

Axon's inventory is that of both Bruno Underbite and [Darby
Snapwish](/wiki/Darby_Snapwish "wikilink").

## Before LEGO Universe

Axon Klaxon originated as the Robot from Series 1 Minifigures.

According to his bio on the Minifigures website, Axon Klaxon is obsessed
with building, to the point where he will even fry his own circuits
while building. Nobody, not even Axon, knows the the Robot's origins or
builder. Axon Klaxon possesses maximum strength and creativity but only
average speed. Axon Klaxon is the playable character in the Brick
Builder online game and is one of the possible results for the "Which
Sci-Fi Minifigure are you?" quiz. In a short animation, Axon Klaxon is
among the Minifigures watching the Clown juggle accessories.

## Trivia

    from the neuron's cell body. A klaxon is a loud electric horn
    formerly used on motor vehicles.
