[Flogmore](/wiki/Flogmore "wikilink") is a Stromling Admiral invader on [Crux
Prime](/wiki/Crux_Prime "wikilink"). He is a [Named
Enemy](/wiki/Named_Enemies "wikilink").

Like other named enemies, Flogmore is more difficult to defeat. If you
do not beware of his harpoon which is considerably more powerful then
that of a normal [Stromling Admiral](/wiki/Stromling_Admiral "wikilink"),
Flogmore will quickly be able to smash you. Beware, his attack is much
more quick to launch and complete then a normal [Stromling
Admiral](/wiki/Stromling_Admiral "wikilink").

## Attacks

-   **Cannon Fire**: Flogmore launches its hook a short distance,
    pulling in the target if close and planting the hook in the ground.
    He will then rapidly fires purple rings of fire from its cannon,
    each doing 8-12 damage, before retracting the hook. The best way to
    attack is to circle him (multiple times if necessary), get him to
    plant his hook, and attack from behind. He will keep attacking where
    the hook is. He generally fires 5 shots per volley, and the shots
    have a knockback effect.
