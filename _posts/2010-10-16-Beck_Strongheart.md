**![](Strongheart.png "Strongheart.png")Commander Beck Strongheart** is
the leader of the [Sentinel](/wiki/Sentinel "wikilink")
[encampment](/wiki/Sentinel_Camp "wikilink") in the [Avant
Gardens](/wiki/Avant_Gardens "wikilink"). He gives out a variety of
[missions](missions "wikilink") which reward emotes, your first helmet,
and some [coins](coin "wikilink"). He is a high-ranking Sentinel but
appears not to have much of a role in the game, as he simply introduces
beginners to some new skills.

-   After an update he was given a few more missions that gave players
    more backpack space.

<!-- -->

-   He leads a squad of NPCs (mainly grunts) .

<!-- -->

-   He is a very high rank but only has a \*Rank two Sentinel knight
    helmet.

[Epsilon Starcracker](/wiki/Epsilon_Starcracker "wikilink") makes reference to
him several times during his introductory missions. His name was also
featured as the sender of a letter on [Venture
Explorer](/wiki/Venture_Explorer "wikilink") during Beta, however the name was
changed to Epsilon after [Return to the Venture
Explorer](/wiki/Venture_Explorer "wikilink") was launched. Also, Beck appeared
to know [Sky Lane](/wiki/Sky_Lane "wikilink"). He sent her a coded
transmission telling her that she should evacuate the [Venture
Explorer](/wiki/Venture_Explorer "wikilink") because he could not get support
there in time.
