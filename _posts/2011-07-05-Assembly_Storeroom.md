The **Assembly Storeroom** is a two room area of [Nexus
Tower](/wiki/Nexus_Tower_(World) "wikilink"). It is home to several brick
[Vendors](/wiki/Vendors "wikilink"), noteably one from the
[Assembly](/wiki/Assembly "wikilink") [Faction](Faction "wikilink").

The storerooms can only be accessed using a [Brick
Warp](/wiki/Brick_Warp "wikilink"), which lifts users from the ground level
and flings them via a pipe into the storeroom, or the [Vacuum
Tubes](/wiki/Vacuum_Tube "wikilink"), which link the two together.

[Torbert Oscillator](/wiki/Torbert_Oscillator "wikilink") resides on one side
of the storerooms. His booth directly faces the preforming [Gwen
Tweenbangle](/wiki/Gwen_Tweenbangle "wikilink"), who is singing pop music of
the [Nexus Force](/wiki/Nexus_Force "wikilink"). Gwen sells Micro City and
[Nimbus Station](/wiki/Nimbus_Station "wikilink") Models to players.

The other side of the storeroom is home to [Axon
Klaxon](/wiki/Axon_Klaxon "wikilink"), brick vendor, [Barry
Smoothmoves](/wiki/Barry_Smoothmoves "wikilink"), construction model vendor,
and the [Model Vending Machine](/wiki/Model_Vending_Machine "wikilink"), which
sells office models.

When [Doctor Overbuild](/wiki/Doctor_Overbuild "wikilink") begins building a
Property Scanner, he sends players to Axon to buy a 6x6 dish so he can
complete it.

Later, when Assembly Members collect parts from [Crux
Prime](/wiki/Crux_Prime "wikilink") and assemble a Sabor-Toothed Cat
[Pet](/wiki/Pet "wikilink"), it escapes and hides in a vacuum tube in the
storerooms. Players must head to the store room and activate the console
beside Torbert to drop the cat out of the tubes so they can tame it.

## Trivia

-   The [Imagination Nexus](/wiki/Imagination_Nexus "wikilink") can be seen
    from the storerooms.
-   It is considered to be one area by NPCs and [Nexus Force
    Plaques](/wiki/Nexus_Force_Plaque "wikilink"), although [Explore the Tower
    2](/wiki/Explore_the_Tower_2 "wikilink") counts it as two.
